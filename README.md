- 👋 Hello, I’m @omarD4v!
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end web development (for now)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end development (JavaScript, Sass, React).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on certain proyects I have in mind, with the aim of improve my abilities.
- 📫 You can reach me via Quora (Omar David Mendez Montiel) or Telegram (@Omar280107)

I'm 16 years old and I'm trying to start in this world of web development. If you are a student too, it would be cool to learn
new stuff with you (and other people in the future). 
Any help will be well-received, thank you.

Ps: I'm from Venezuela and my English isn't very good for now, sorry xd (Soy de Venezuela y mi inglés no es muy bueno por ahora, lo siento xd)
